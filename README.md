#Haskell-2048-DEYORS (English)

The 2048 game programmed in Haskell, making use of the IO interface and other implementations that improve the gameplay, such as the option of having different designs and instructions.

The game makes use of the extensions:

import Data.List (transpose) -> Naturally integrated, there is nothing to install.

import System.Random -> Naturally integrated, there is nothing to install. However, in some versions of WinGHCi it does not run properly. It is recommended to run the game in WinHugs to avoid problems.

**EXECUTION OF THE GAME**

1. Install WinHugs and open it.
2. Drag the file to the window and drop inside.
3. When the message that it has been loaded successfully appears, execute
the command :main.
4. Follow the instructions.
